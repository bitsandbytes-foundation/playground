      1 torch._dynamo.exc.InternalTorchDynamoError: A view was created in no_grad mode and its base or another view of its base has been modified inplace with grad mode enabled. Given that this use case is ambiguous and error-prone, it is forbidden. You can clarify your code by moving both the view and the inplace either both inside the no_grad block (if you don't want the inplace to be tracked) or both outside (if you want the inplace to be tracked).
